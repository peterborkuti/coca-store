I tested it with ZBar but it worked, but with a fearly low probability.\r\nIt can be improved with a special case made around the webcam and some LEDs for the appropriate lightning, but I rejected this idea\r\nbecause making a case, testing it and using can be a long running task\r\n\r\n#### Plan II - Button controlled selector\r\n\r\nA two-layered UI with buttons of Coca Cola products. First the buttons from here: [products](https://secure.coca-cola.hu/content/hu/corporate/markaink.aspx) than the images of the real products.\r\n\r\nI rejected it because it is not \"geek\" enough, however, I planned to code it.\r\n\r\n#### Plan III - Voice Regognition System\r\n\r\nUser say a name of a product, or just some keywords, like \"zero\" (which can points both to Coca Cola Zero and Fanta Zero Orange), than user says \"fanta\" and boom, the product selected by the app. Than user says how many bottles (like 1 or 2 or 6) than \"ok\" or \"cancel\".\r\n\r\nHere you can test the first version [speech](speech/index.html)\r\n",
